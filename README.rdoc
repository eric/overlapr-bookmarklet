= Overlapr Bookmarklet

A simple bookmarklet for doing quick lookups on http://overlapr.com

It allows for finding overlaps between yourself and other people you browse
on twitter.

I created this because I wanted a simple way to find if people who followed
me have any overlaps.

To install the bookmarklet, head over to:
